# Emergency Vehicle Detection

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook aimed at classifying images of vehicles into two categories: **emergency vehicles** and **non-emergency vehicles**. The project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification. This README includes a detailed breakdown of the steps to assist both beginners and experts.

## General Knowledge of work done

Image classification is a computer vision task where we teach a model to recognize patterns in images and assign them to predefined categories. This project classifies vehicles based on whether they are emergency vehicles or not. Here’s an overview of what happens step by step:

1. **Importing Libraries**:
   - We begin by importing essential libraries like TensorFlow for building the model, Pandas for handling tabular data, and Matplotlib for plotting results.
   - Each library has a specific role: TensorFlow is used for deep learning, while Pandas and NumPy handle data efficiently.

2. **Data Loading**:
   - Training and testing data are loaded from CSV files that provide the file names and labels (0 for non-emergency, 1 for emergency).
   - The dataset also includes images stored in directories.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Before training the model, we explore the data to understand its structure and confirm it’s suitable for the task.
   - For instance, we check the number of images for each category and visualize some samples.

4. **Preprocessing**:
   - Images are resized and augmented to make the model more robust. Augmentation involves random changes to images (like flipping or zooming) to simulate real-world variations.
   - The dataset is split into training and validation subsets.

5. **Building the Model**:
   - A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is created. CNNs are especially good at recognizing patterns in images (e.g., edges, shapes, and objects).
   - Layers like `Conv2D` extract image features, while `MaxPooling2D` reduces dimensionality. Fully connected `Dense` layers make predictions based on extracted features.

6. **Training the Model**:
   - The model learns by analyzing training images and adjusting itself to minimize prediction errors.
   - We use `EarlyStopping` to halt training if the model stops improving, which prevents overfitting.

7. **Evaluation**:
   - The model’s accuracy is tested using unseen validation data.
   - Metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall are calculated to measure its performance.

8. **Visualization**:
   - Results are visualized using graphs to show how well the model performed during training and testing.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/emergency-vehicle-detection.git
   cd emergency-vehicle-detection
   ```

2. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Dataset

The dataset includes two main files:
- `train.csv`: Contains image file names and labels.
- `test.csv`: Contains image file names for evaluation.

Images must be organized in a folder structure as shown:
```
data/
├── train/
│   ├── 001.jpg
│   ├── 002.jpg
│   └── ...
├── test/
│   ├── 001.jpg
│   ├── 002.jpg
│   └── ...
train.csv
test.csv
```

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook EmergencyVehicle.ipynb
   ```

2. Follow these steps:
   - **Step 1**: Import necessary libraries.
   - **Step 2**: Load and explore the dataset.
   - **Step 3**: Preprocess the data (resize, augment, and split).
   - **Step 4**: Build and compile the CNN model.
   - **Step 5**: Train the model with training data.
   - **Step 6**: Evaluate the model on validation data.
   - **Step 7**: Visualize results.

## Results

- **Metrics**: Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Visualizations**: Training/validation accuracy and loss graphs, along with sample predictions.
